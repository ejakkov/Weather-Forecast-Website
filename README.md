# Weather-Forecast-Website

A Website made using an API with HTML, JavaScript, and JSON.

Project Scenario

The team at a European travel agency is trying to increase travel bookings. To do this, they want to provide an ability for their website visitors to look up a 5 day weather forecast for major European cities.

They want you to create a webpage that will retrieve weather forecasts from an external service. This feature will help the agency maximize their travel bookings and sales through their website.

! IMPORTANT NOTE !
Use a local development server, like Live Server in Visual Studio Code, for local testing. This is the recommended approach as it closely simulates how the website will behave when deployed to a web server. However, plainly opening index.html using double-click most probably will lead you to CORS policy related error.
